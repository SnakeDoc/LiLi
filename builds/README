To copy to SD card:

1) fdisk -l

2) find your SD card (if using a USB adapter, it may appear as /dev/sda instead of /dev/mmcblk0)
    ****Please note, this will be destructive to all data on your SD card!
    - To be certain you have the correct device, try using the 'fdisk -l' command without
        the SD card plugged in --> plug in your SD card --> run 'fdisk -l' again and compare the output.
    - The new device listed in the secound output will likely be your SD card.
    - Depending on how your SD card is plugged into your computer, it may appear in a few different ways.
    - If plugged in via a USB adapter, it will likely appears like just another hard disk drive in your
        system, such as /dev/sdc or /dev/sdb, etc. Be careful, because your Operating System hard disk
        drive will likely appear as /dev/sda or similar, **do not mix them up!**
    - If you plugged in directly to a card reader, it may appear as a mmc device, such as /dev/mmcblk0
        or /dev/mmcblk1, or similar.
        
    ** Again, take care in this step to find your SD card. Proceeding will destroy all data on the chosen device! **

3) fdisk /dev/sdc

  sequence:

    n,p,1,[ENTER],+128M,n,p,2,[ENTER],[ENTER],t,1,c,a,1,p,w

    This creates two new partitions, the first as a FAT32 boot partition of 128MB,
      and the second as an EXT4 partition filling the remainder of the SD card's capacity.
    The 'p' switch will print the pending changes for review. 'w' will write the changes.
    
4) Format our partitions:

    mkfs.vfat /dev/sdc1
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc2

5) Make a working directory:

    mkdir -pv lili_staging/rootfs
    cd lili_staging/

6) Mount our EXT4 partition:

    mount /dev/sdc2 rootfs/

7) Make out boot/ directory

    mkdir -pv rootfs/boot

8) Mount our FAT32 boot partition:

    mount -t vfat /dev/sdc1 rootfs/boot/

9) Copy our root filesystem to our mounted SD cart:

    cp -arv <path>/<to>/<unpacked>/<download>/* rootfs/

    ex: cp -arv /home/jason/20140116-lili-0.1.0-armv6zk-rpi/* rootfs/

    The 'a' switch "archives" the files and directories, meaning it preserves file permissions and special permissions.
    The 'r' switch is for recursive because we're copying directories as well as files.
    The 'v' switch is for verbose mode, so we can see what it's doing.

10) Use the 'sync' command to ensure all data has been copied over and our hard drive buffers flushed.

    sync

11) Un-mount our partitions in the correct order:

    umount rootfs/boot/
    umount rootfs/

12) Pop the SD card into your Raspberry Pi and enjoy!
